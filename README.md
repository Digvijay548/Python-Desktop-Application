# Python-Desktop-Application Using customkinter

This is a desktop application which was created using python.



Introduction to this project 

1)This is a desktop application created using the **python customketkinter module.**

2) In this application **Zebra Barcode Scanner, Zebra printer 410T,Pylon Industrial Camera integrated** in this application.

3) we have also **integrated C# DLL for events through the Windows machine that helps to get the status of the devices**.

4) I have also decoded **Barcodes through the zebra scanner** and also we have **decoded 2D Datamatrix which from camera**.







# FOLLOWING MODULES REQUIRED TO RUN THIS PROJECT



  **Note this project builds on Python 3.8 version, so install python 3.8 version**

  

1) **Pythonnet And clr** → for interaction with c# dll (first install Pythonnet then install Clr)

2) **customtkinter** → for Design gui Application

3) **PIL** → For image processing and vision.

4) **opencv** → For drawing rectangles in images like barcode detection.

5) **socket** → For device integration like scanner printer.

6) **Event dll** → which is getting c# events and getting to python code which makes responsive gui

7) **pylibdmtx** → **this is This main module which is responsible for decoding database or other 2Dbarcode code decoding**
